# Data Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects of various topics. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the projects included in this portfolio.

## Projects

1. [Tableau dash - Granit Xhaka shots](./GranitXhakaBirthday/): In this project I created an interactive dashboard using Tableau. The Dashboard aims to provide a self-service visualization that allows you to explore a soccer player's shots and their results throughout history. Additionally, I've included a data scraping Python script to gather the necessary data for the dashboard.
   
2. [Data Analytics - OOTP](./OOTP/): This project aims to determine the optimal roster for a baseball team in the online game Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP). It involves collecting game logs, cleaning and aggregating them, followed by visualization of several relationships between variables. Several machine learning models were built and tested, selecting the best one to help make the roster decision.

3. [Scraping for DL model training - Steam](./TranslationCorpusScraping/): The objective of this project is to gather data by scraping in order to create a parallel corpus for training a deep learning translation model.
